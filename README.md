# rStats

rStats aims to provide a way of measuring and visualizing performance of your code, mainly in apps based on an update loop, like games or interactive experiences.

Feel free to view the [introduction and demos](https://spite.github.io/rstats).


# Usage

If you would like to embed this library in your project, simply download this file and host it alongside your project:

[`rStats.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spite/rstats/master/src/rStats.js)

The script can also be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Bower](http://bower.io/), as it's wrapped with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) so it can be used directly as an AMD module.

To install from npm:

    npm install rstats-js

To install from bower:

    bower install rstats-js

And, in your CommonJS modules ([Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), etc.), simply require the module:

    require('rstats-js')
